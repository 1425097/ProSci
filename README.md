# ProSci
ProSci Tool<br/>
<br/>
• start the ’prosci.sh’ with your terminal.<br/>
• create a new workspace if you don’t have any workspace currently in your application.
Our suggestion is to create a workspace with default name prosci. So the workspace
creation command is like the following: workspace prosci [path]<br/>
• start you working section on your current workspace. with command: start<br/>
• copy the sample.sh and sample.tex into the home directory of your [workspace
path]/input folder.<br/>
• run the sample.sh in the current working section terminal.<br/>
• as you complete to run the sample.sh. You can find some new files in your workspace
home folder, they are:<br/>
– FL_insurance_sample.csv.zip<br/>
– FL_insurance_sample.csv<br/>
– FL_insurance_sample_sub.csv<br/>
– sample.aux<br/>
– sample.log<br/>
– sample.pdf<br/>
– sample.tex<br/>
– sample.sh<br/>
– out.txt<br/>
• Now let’s use the advanced feature of the ProSci tool. Optionally, you can close<br/>
the working section terminal (Xterm), but it is not necessary. Switch back to the
Prosci main terminal, type the command ’graphic’ to initialize our graph visualizer.
After some seconds, a new window is opened. From there you can get an overview
of the ontology structure of the sample project.<br/>
• Totally, you have four options in our graph visualizer. The overview shows you with
a ontology graph, it illustrates the connectivity between every activity(command),
entity (file) and agent(software agent). You can click on the graph to choose the
element, the details of each element in the graph will be displayed as a table. As
an alternative you can also search each property on the dashboard on the left of
the visualizer’s window. They are sorted into three catalogs, respectively, activities,
files and agents.<br/>
